### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### ENTITY_FRAMEWORK

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}
