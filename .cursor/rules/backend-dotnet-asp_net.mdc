### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### ASP_NET

- Use minimal APIs for simple endpoints in .NET 8+ applications to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the mediator pattern with MediatR for decoupling request handling and simplifying cross-cutting concerns
- Use API controllers with model binding and validation attributes for {{complex_data_models}}
- Apply proper response caching with cache profiles and ETags for improved performance on {{high_traffic_endpoints}}
- Implement proper exception handling with ExceptionFilter or middleware to provide consistent error responses
- Use dependency injection with scoped lifetime for request-specific services and singleton for stateless services
